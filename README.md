# Detective - Farcaster Mini App

🔍 **An AI-powered social deduction game on Farcaster**

Can you tell if you're chatting with a real person or an AI bot trained on their posts?

## About

Detective is a Farcaster mini app where players engage in short conversations and guess whether they're speaking with another real user or an intelligent bot. The bot is trained on the player's recent Farcaster posts, making the impersonation as authentic as possible.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 (Foundation) Complete ✓
**Next**: Phase 2 (AI Integration & Polish) - 1 week
**Target Launch**: Early December 2025

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm/yarn/pnpm
- API keys:
  - [Neynar](https://neynar.com/app/api-keys)
  - [Anthropic Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Setup

1. **Clone and install**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thisyearnofear/detective.git
   cd detective
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Then add your API keys to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (1-2 weeks) ✓
- [x] Next.js project setup with modern tech stack
- [x] In-memory game state store
- [x] Neynar API integration (user fetch, cast scraping, score validation)
- [x] Claude API integration (bot response generation)
- [x] Landing page & error handling

### Phase 2: AI Integration & Polish (1 week)
- [ ] API routes for game flow (register, match, chat, vote, leaderboard)
- [ ] React components (chat UI, voting, leaderboard, timer)
- [ ] Claude prompt engineering & optimization
- [ ] User testing with 5-10 beta players
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness & UX polish

### Future Phases:
- Phase 3: Multi-Game Support (1 week)
- Phase 4: Soft Launch (1 week)
- Phase 5: Growth & Refinement (Ongoing)

## Game Mechanics

### Registration
- Users must have **Neynar score > 0.8** (filters bots/low-quality accounts)
- Hard cap: **50 players per cycle**
- System scrapes 30 recent casts per user for bot training

### Match Phase
- Duration: **4 minutes** per match
- 5 matches per player per cycle
- **50% real users, 50% bots** in random assignment
- Messages exchanged via HTTP polling (3s interval)

### Bot Intelligence
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet fine-tuned with user's recent posts
- System prompt injects: username, display name, recent casts, tone & style
- Instruction to stay under 240 chars (Farcaster limit)

### Voting & Scoring
- After each match: Guess "Real" or "Bot"
- Accuracy calculated per user: (Correct Guesses / Total Guesses) × 100
- Leaderboard sorted by accuracy and speed (tiebreaker)

## Costs

**Per game cycle** (50 players, 5 rounds = 250 bot responses):
- Neynar API: Free tier (10k req/day limit, we use ~200)
- Claude API: ~$0.75 (250 responses × $0.003/response)
- Vercel: Free tier
- **Total: <$1 per game**

**Budget estimate**: $50-100/month for 10 games (assuming weekly cycles)
